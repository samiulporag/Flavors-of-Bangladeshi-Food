        <h3>No Food, No Life</h3>
        <p>Bangladeshi people follow certain rules and regulations while eating. It includes warm hospitality and
            particular
            ways of serving as well. This is known as Bangaliketa (Bengali: বাঙালি কেতা). The culture also defines the
            way to
            invite people to weddings and for dinner. Gifts are given on certain occasions. Bangaliketa also includes
